/*
    Unified timestamp + block_num resolution.
    Uses coalesce instead of `isNull(X) OR timestamp >= (subquery)` because
    the OR pattern prevents ClickHouse from recognizing a clean primary-key range,
    causing a full scan. With coalesce, ClickHouse always sees direct bounds,
    enabling granule skipping on the primary index.
    When no lower bound → falls back to epoch (toDateTime(0)) → no-op.
    When no upper bound → falls back to now() → no-op.
/* Only clamp to 1 hour when no narrowing filters are active.
   start_time/start_block are already incorporated into start_ts, so the
   clamp's greatest() handles them correctly without disabling it. */

    NOTE: block_num filtering is limited — unlike swaps/transfers, the NFT database
    has no `blocks` table to resolve block_num → timestamp, so block filters are applied
    as secondary WHERE clauses after the timestamp clamp. This means block-only queries
    are constrained to the 10-minute window. For accurate wide-range block_num filtering,
    a blocks table needs to be added to the NFT substreams:
    https://github.com/pinax-network/substreams-evm/issues/175
